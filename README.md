# N64 Sound Tools
Unofficial repository for Subdrag's N64SoundTools

I have created my version of this repository, not to contain the most updated content for building the application, but to be a reference for any that come across it, directing them to the official resources and other information.

In the hopes of possibly contributing to the codebase through socialo programming, I found this repository from another user without finding any others: https://github.com/derselbst/N64SoundTools
I also noticed the recent download I found on the internet seemed to have code that was a bit newer than was in that repository, by way of checking the diff for several files.

I have contacted SubDrag, and found that he has even worked on the project recently, but is more comfortable uploading it to this site without doig anything extra like setting up and maintaing a reposiroty on GitHub.

So with that, some of the offical resources are here:
