# N64 Sound Tools
Unofficial repository for Subdrag's N64SoundTools

This repository was founded in the hopes of possibly contributing to the codebase through social programming and to be a reference for anyone who comes across it, directing them to the official resources and other information. It is not meant to contain the most updated content for building the application.

[Pysis868](https://github.com/Pysis868) has contacted [SubDrag](https://github.com/SubDrag), and found that he will work on this project from time to time, but is more comfortable uploading it to [GoldenEye Vault](http://www.goldeneyevault.com) without doing anything extra like setting up and maintaining a repository on GitHub.
