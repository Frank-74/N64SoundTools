# N64 Sound Tools
Unofficial repository for Subdrag's N64SoundTools

I have created my version of this repository, not to contain the most updated content for building the application, but to be a reference for any that come across it, directing them to the official resources and other information.

In the hopes of possibly contributing to the codebase through social programming, I found this repository from another user without finding any others: https://github.com/derselbst/N64SoundTools
I also noticed the recent download I found on the internet seemed to have code that was a bit newer than was in that repository, by way of checking the diff for several files.

I have contacted [SubDrag](https://github.com/SubDrag), and found that he has even worked on the project recently, but is more comfortable uploading it to this site without doing anything extra like setting up and maintaining a repository on GitHub.

So with that, here are the
